# Dotfiles

This repo includes all of the necessary dots I need.

Dependencies:
- picom
- polybar
- One of these WMs:
    - i3
    - qtile
    - awesomewm
- font awesome
- Ubuntu Mono
- Noto Fonts
- neovim
- zsh
- alacritty
- rofi
- playerctl

# Notes
- To activate i3lock, enter the following
```sh
xset 600
xset -dpms
```
- `xset 600` means show the lockscreen in 600 secs
- `xset -dpms` means don't turn off the screen
- I am currently using i3, so use qtile and awesome with care; a lot will break
